<h1>CatClicker</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
This project was created during Udacity's frontend nanodegree program. The styling and content was up to the developer. I ended up choosing animated cats for a user to learn about and click at.

<h2>Build Status</h2>
This project is currently being edited as of April 2019. 

<h2>Tech/Frameworks used</h2>
Frameworks used include:
<ul>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>Boostrap</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
The name of the project is very self explanatory. I've chosen some of the cats that were highlights from my youth and listed them in the dropdown menu. Choose a cat, learn a fact about them and click to see a counter increment.
