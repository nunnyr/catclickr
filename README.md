#CatClicker 

##Motivation 
This project was created during Udacity's frontend nanodegree program. The styling and content was up to the developer. I ended up choosing animated cats for a user to learn about and click at.

##Build Status
This project is currently being edited as of April 2019. 

##Tech/Frameworks used
Frameworks used include:
    *HTML & CSS
    *JavaScript
    *jQuery
    *Boostrap

##How to use?
The name of the project is very self explanatory. I've chosen some of the cats that were highlights from my youth and listed them in the dropdown menu. Choose a cat, learn a fact about them and click to see a counter increment.
